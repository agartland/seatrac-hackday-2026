## Objectives

Learning, teaching and collaborating! Collaborate in small groups to dive into TB drug treatment trial data. Help clean and prepare analysis datasets for meta-analysis, creating a resource for the field. Conduct preliminary analyses across trials gaining insights into drug side-effects, and the challenges/promise of meta-analysis.
